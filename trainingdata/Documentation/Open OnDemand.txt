Instruction can be found in the Compute1 Quickstart.Point browser to http://ood.ris.wustl.edu.FilesDisplay files and directories in the user’s home directory.Due to OnDemand implementation restrictions, navigation to storageN or scratch1 cannot be done through this page.JobsView active jobsUse Job Composer to create scripts and launch batch jobs.Active JobsLists user’s currently pending and running jobs on compute1 (not exclusive to those launched via OnDemand).Select the red trash bin to the right of the job listing to terminate a job (same as bkill).Select the arrow to the left of the job listing to view job details (same as bjobs output).Job ComposerCreate and launch batch jobs similar to using a .bsub job file.Job and resource parameter information can be found on the https://washu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RUD/pages/1705182249/Job+Execution+Examples?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZTg4Y2E4Nzc0YzgzNDAxNWE5MmExYWNhMWNiZDk5ZDIiLCJwIjoiYyJ9 page.Jobs can be created from: - Default template - Specified path - Existing job (running or completed).Once a source is selected an editor will become available.Sample job file:#!/bin/bash
#BSUB -q general
#BSUB -g /username/groupname
#BSUB -a 'docker(ubuntu)'

echo "Hello World"If a member of more than one compute group, specify the LSF User Group with #BSUB -G group_name.The -g option must be included here.Each bsub option must have its own #BSUB line.Click Save.Select Submit to launch a new batch job using a created script.ClustersLaunch command-line and batch jobs from a terminal session.Access to all compute1 resources available from this client node.Interactive AppsRun interactive jobs with GUI. Select application name from the Interactive Apps dropdown.Configure storage/scratch mounts and resource options for the job.Select Launch to submit the job.Ability to run custom images that specifically leverage the RIS noVNC image via the Custom noVNC Image application. This application also allows for extended resource usage such as spanning multiple hosts.Custom noVNC Image Requirement:The Custom noVNC Image in Open OnDemand is only guaranteed to run if leveraging the current RIS noVNC version(s) due to the included dependencies and startup scripts. Instruction on extending this image is found in the RIS noVNC image documentation.My Interactive SessionsView pending and running interactive sessions.Status - Queued: Submitted job is in queue to launch.Status - Starting: Job is in the process of launching (image download, startup scripts running, etc).Status - Running: Job has started and is ready to launch a GUI.Job sessions can be terminated in the My Interactive Sessions page.TerminalThere are multiple locations from which a user can launch a terminal.Exactly as expected, this is a terminal that is launched through the web-browser allowing users to do command line work.
