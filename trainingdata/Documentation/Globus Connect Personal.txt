We will display a login URL. Copy it into any browser and log in to get a
single-use code. Return to this command with the code to continue setup.

setup completed successfullyThe compute1-exec-N that is used comes from the node the job lands on.This is important to remember for the next step and any future use of Globus through this method.Running on Compute1After the initial setup, the following command can be used to start up the client at any time.PATH=/opt/globus/globusconnectpersonal-3.1.4:$PATH LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES="$HOME:$HOME /path/to/directory:/path/to/directory" bsub -q general -m compute1-exec-N -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/globus)' globusconnectpersonal -start -restrict-paths rw~/,rw/path/to/directory,/tmp/path/to/directory is the same directory and path that was enabled in the setup part of the process.compute1-exec-N needs to be replaced with the same node name that the setup step ran on.N represents a number that is the number of one of the nodes.If you are a member of more than one compute group, you will be prompted to specify an LSF User Group with -G group_name or by setting the LSB_SUB_USER_GROUP variable.The endpoint that is the local or scratch directory can be now accessed via the web app and used for data transfer.https://app.globus.org/
