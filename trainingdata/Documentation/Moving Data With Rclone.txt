Through the command rclone config, you will create a credential file for rclone to connect to your WashU Box on your local computer. By copying the file to your home directory on RIS compute1 client, you will be able to access your Box storage through your rclone container on a compute1 exec node.PrerequisitesA WashU Box accountA user account for RIS storageN and compute1 servicesBuilding an EndpointInstallationFor macOS users, run the following command to install rclone with Homebrew.> brew install rcloneFor Windows users, download the relevant archive file from https://rclone.org/downloads/  for your environment. Then, extract the rclone.exe binary from the archive.For Linux/BSD users, run the following command to install rclone.> curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bashConfigurationCreating the configuration file for the connection to WUSTL BoxOpen a terminal where rclone has been installedRun rclone config to start the interactive process. > rclone config

Approve the access on your Duo App.Grant the access for rclone to connect to Box. Then, your will see the confirmation of the process. An email notification from box will be sent to you with the subject: Box login from “rclone”.Close the browser. The configuration for rclone connection to Box will be displayed on your terminal.
