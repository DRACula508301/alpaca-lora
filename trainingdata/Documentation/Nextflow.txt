-profile test \
-c /scratch1/fs1/ris/application/nextflow/conf/rnaseq.config \
--outdir /path/to/outdirCommand-Line SessionsIf you are a member of more than one compute group, you will be prompted to specify an LSF User Group with -G group_name or by setting the LSB_SUB_USER_GROUP variable.Interactive SessionIf users wish to use Nextflow in an interactive command-line session, it can be done via the THPC terminal.Users can find out about using the THPC terminal here.Users can use Nextflow just like with OOD.Users must include /scratch1/fs1/ris:/scratch1/fs1/ris in the LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES environment variable.Make sure the directory to be used as the Nextflow working directory is included in the LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES environment variable.LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES="/scratch1/fs1/ris:/scratch1/fs1/ris /storageN/fs1/${STORAGE_ALLOCATION}/Active:/storageN/fs1/{$STORAGE_ALLOCATION}/Active" \
thpc-terminal bash -c "cd /path/to/nextflow/working/directory ; nextflow run nf-core/sarek -profile test -c /scratch1/fs1/ris/application/nextflow/conf/rnaseq.config --outdir /path/to/nextflow/working/directory"/path/to/nextflow/working/directory is the path to the Nextflow working directory.Batch SessionIf users wish to use Nextflow in an batch session, it can be done via the THPC batch.Users can find out about using the THPC terminal here.Users must include /scratch1/fs1/ris:/scratch1/fs1/ris in the LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES environment variable.Make sure the directory to be used as the Nextflow working directory is included in the LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES environment variable.LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES="/scratch1/fs1/ris:/scratch1/fs1/ris /storageN/fs1/${STORAGE_ALLOCATION}/Active:/storageN/fs1/{$STORAGE_ALLOCATION}/Active" \

    executor = "lsf"
    queue    = { "general" }
    clusterOptions =  { "-a 'docker(quay.io/${task.container})' -G compute-ris -J rnaseq -env 'all,PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin'" }
}

executor {
    queueSize = 7
    submitRateLimit = '1/1sec'
}
